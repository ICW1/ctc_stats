       "\"[Music] hello and welcome to a new gas video genuinely approachable soku that's what gas stands for and these puzzles get posted by Clover Bill Murphy and Philip Newman on The Daily sodoku puzzle channel on the Discord server I solve them about a month behind I try and wrap up 5 days in a row I did notice when loading up the puzzles a moment ago that there are six puzzles this time which is exciting um we'll find out why no doubt when I read the blurbs from Discord in a moment now the patreon contest is closed but there is always extra content on patreon so do check that out also of course we have our gas apps out and a new line sodoku app and they're amongst all all the apps that we have and do check out the links under the video those are some great puzzles to practice your solving on um you will be getting better at variant soku if you try them and you'll be getting get better at Classic sodoku if you try the classic sodoku app um also you can get Sven sadoku pad and our merchandise now last week's gas video was I noticed one of the longest I've recorded is about 45 minutes and that was despite the fact that I didn't make any bone errors I didn't miss any two hat times and I think this is indicative of the fact that the puzzles were quite hard last week we will see if that was noticed um at the time and whether they've got a bit easier for this week or indeed whether they're just beginning the the gas giants are just beginning to Trend harder and harder no idea what we're going to find um or indeed whether the blurs will mention it at all but we are going to attack these puzzles now I'm going to no I'm not going to attack them first I'm going to read the blurs first and tell you what the constructors said about the puzzles and so on and so forth we start with this outside sidoku by Clover um normal sodoku rules apply that is putting one to nine in every row column and box and I'm sure oops I'm sure that's likely to apply in all the puzzles we do that's normal sedok rules Clues outside the grid are digits that must appear in the first three cells from that direction in that row or column in any order so these three cells will be 1 eight and nine and one of these is a five that's what we get uh sometimes called frame sodoku but it was called outside sodoku at the World sodoku Championship last week um now the next puzzle ah this is the day where we get two so sorry I've just read you the rules rather rather than what Clover wrote about the previous puzzle that's so embarrassing okay let's try that again so what's actually going to happen on the sedok con fundraising stream you may ask um I think that's happening in mid November Clover Philip and Bill will checks notes fight to the death hm not sure who put that one in there philli was that you um Joe vshy Pebble and friends will teach you to solve pencil puzzles they might be fighting to the death too not sure yet for full deck and missing a few cards will do something terribly clever and make us all feel clever too and it's Stark Jr and John accompanied by carabet have been given free reign to be their beautiful speed setting hosting sves during the late late night block and way more but I'm getting tired of typing and have to leave something to the imagination there we go sodoku contrail um today's gas is an outside sidoku we did the rules a moment ago and that is still true there is a for instance in the rules but I kind of did you a for instance the dinosaur now there are you get a dinosaur if you solve the puzzle but if you solve it in a certain time you get a hat a party hat instead and in an even quicker time two party hats and I'm always going for them myself so the dinosaur in this instance is a long Delong apparently now then we then we do go on to build day and it says I've been in on sick girlfriend caring Duty for the last 3 days and forgot to make any clever intros for gas or negative constraint puzzles in fact I forgot to make anything at all let's see what I've got in my pockets turns out Pockets damn I really just got too many classic soku just lying around I love the idea that bill turn up a classic soku was made before I do hope your girlfriend got better quickly bill um now the puzzle name so there are two classic soku for the day and you're just combining the times for the Hat times comparison and uh normal sedoka rules apply the only odd thing I noticed about these is if you call one of them up in F puzzles it seems to have the wrong title um but it's the right puzzle which was strange the dinosaur is a Dr Doon um and the next day we go on to by Phillip is that really the first time Philip Ed that name I'm not absolutely sure Phillip says welcome to the gas IAQ infrequently asked questions where we provide genuinely approachable answers to your genuinely unasked questions question what would a gas team fight to the death actually look like answer picture a herd of stampeding saour pods on Black Friday would be exactly the opposite of that I like Philip's humor question what is backp like really answer crossed out picture a her of steaming sour pods on Black Friday but it then Sals all hell backpal lord of the puzzles Keeper of the mind's slowest of his name which is a meme description of backp question is it cheating to do a crop key XV peir sodoku and a crop key peir sodoku for the same theme answer yes but would you rather I post the brutal index and puzzle instead I can answer for everyone no we would rather you do not post the brutal indexer puzzle thank you question is four Quest is four questions enough for a dumb IAQ intro answer probably not but maybe clover will do an FAQ tomorrow if you ask nicely and frequently um I will add to that that we don't know if four questions is enough for a dumb IAQ intro because this was not a dumb IAQ intro it was an amusing one now today's guess is a crop Keir sodoku crop keair digits in cells separated by a white dot must be consecutive have a difference of one digits in cells separated by a black dot must have a ratio of 2: one and there's no negative constraint the dinosaur is an inquisitive ingentia and the next puzzle is called 10 to a dozen sidoku by Clover and in this one Clover says let's talk content what's something you'd like to see on the soku on stream shy versus Mark goodliff rap battle nobody wants to see that Clover a tour through Phillip's spiciest gas out takes everybody wants to see that Clover let's hear it and I'll do my best to make it happen today's gas is a 10 to a dozen sodoku a variant that featured in the recent USA sodoku qualifier except that I've yeeted the negative constraint right on out of it um normal sedok rules apply pairs of digits separated by a black rectangle either add to 10 or to 12 or multiply to 10 or to 12 not all possible rectangles are necessarily given the dinosaur is a discal disoosa surus and there's one more puzzle to do six puzzles today it's a lot by Bill one day my Dad pulled up a chair sat me on his lap and said Son someday we'll buy a second chair I'm happy with that joke as well oh they've put me in a good mood these guys today's guas is a killer soku normal soku rules apply digits and cages must not repeat and must sum to the small Corner total the dinosaur is a comedic genius genod does and indeed bill you are a comedic genius right that is the blurs that is the rules those are the puzzles I'm mixing up my singulars and plurals we are going to have a go at these puzzles now and I'm going to restart my clock each time and then announce at the end by looking it up whether I have achieved the two hat time let's get cracking so 189 234 pencil marking is your friend here not so good on paper actually one must be there that's two and three we know where three goes there because of the pairs and triples we're creating 4 five six loads of triples everywhere here oh that was a just poor pair writing 1 2 3 4 8 9 1 56 789 now let's I'm just going to keep doing this I'm sorry it may not be the most elegant or beautiful way of solving this puzzle but it is almost certainly going to be the way that I get to my potentially quickest time and I'm all about the two hats with each puzzle yeah this is this is worth doing I know it's a bit laborious um but I I don't care I just don't care 345 6 7 8 1 n in two of those cells and two in the middle 1 2 3 4 5 6 oh we know where the six goes 789 there and then we've got 126 I mean I could be wrong this might not be the quick way to solve the puzzle and I'm not claiming it is quick I'm just claiming it's going to it's going to not be terrible as a way of solving the puzzle yeah look at that these triples just get revealed by these few um vertical digits that have been placed that's really interesting and surprising to me it just shows you Clover understands the mechanics of these puzzles very well um 159 must be able to do this set by now y can I do the 459 yes and then look 489 so that's suddenly just completed columns 4 five six now that five is looking down at the bottom that six is looking up at the top so we can place six there now we get seven done oops if I could type it we would get it done that gets eight done that looks like nine must be done that looks like one can be done and actually this has worked really well to give me a kind of flow with which to do the puzzle which means I always know where to look next which is an unbelievable benefit in trying to record a fast time um and we're going to repeat the same process here every time I get a double digit in the columns I know to look to that row next 5 7 six I think the time for this is going to end up being brilliantly quick but it's really just a matter of sort of locking into the method that is best to solve it there we go 3 minutes and 6 seconds now that's not the fastest time I've ever posted on a puzzle and frankly we'll see if I can beat that on the classics that are about to come up but it's a pretty good time it's obviously I think going to get the two hats let's just check the time on those 6 minutes for two hats so relatively straightforward puzzle possibly it is a reaction to the rather more difficult puzzles last week and then Bill's posting Bill confessed basically that he wasn't posting these Classics because of easiness or difficulty he was posting them cuz his girlfriend's sick and he didn't have time which I respect let's get cracking on the first one okay so we get a three there uh we get a one there this looks very symmetrical doesn't it what can we we oh then it oh yes there's a seven there there is a symmetry thing going on um but I can't keep working out which digits to look for there five 84 5 71 so that's a six now we get a two and a 39 pair we might get a three in the corner that is a one that's naked seven and four there this is a 29 naked pair then we can put one there and we've got three six pair which are either naked or hidden depending on your taste um two five that's a seven this is very straightforward approached in the right way but and again Bill provides so much symmetry that once you found a way to do one part of the puzzle the rest is just going to come to you as long as you look for that symmetry as you go 69 there 257 here I can do one of those digits there we actually I can do the 27 pair now as well probably one of these pairs has been revealed yes the 63 right let's go down this column that's become a three in the corner there it is losing its religion entirely that's a 49 pair three I can put in and a 58 pair let's do seven and a 14 pair then this is 89 oh I expected them to be explained now what's this oh the six is looking all the way across the grid the one fixes that 5 4 6 2 8 and nine two has to be there in row six that is an iwing six is here can finish box five and there we we go we've got two digits left 2 minutes and 9 seconds for the first one now we start off on the second one 2 minutes and 9 seconds to add when we've done this oh lots of easy hidden singles 1 2 3 four uh that is a naked single though that's much harder 1 3 2 4 6 87 246 in which I can do one of them that's a nine with a 5 seven pair above okay let's go across the top yes five and then seven and nine they're all done 7 9185 ah okay let's try this eight is placed 159 triple that sorts out one of those pairs 837 these are from 2 46 six that is two or four so that's a three that's one in the column um now I can place five in box five which was a slight change of slight change of pattern ah now I'm struggling a bit I'm not well I mean I'm not struggling I'm just not quite sure where to go next that's a six now I'm getting a cough out of nowhere 3642 there's a one in one of those that's not a one um 2 39 four there's a one in the bottom row H 3764 that's a naked nine that gives me a nine there that's now a seven four six pair here and another seven 792 36 this must be 45 pair this is a 18 pair they can all go in now I can do well I can do the nine yes I can do them all these are a pair of eye WIS 763 that's a nine eight pair now now that has become an eight four and three here they must go they do and that's all the top sections finished 587 let's put the five in first then 87 81 and what is it 51 there there we go so 242 + 207 is 449 for the two puzzles and the com combined two hat time is 11 minutes which just goes to show I think Classics remain my strong suit now we go to by Phillip and it'll be his only puzzle today so good chance of it being my Nemesis right let's get cracking so we've got black dots with actual numbers on them that's very kind Phillip ooh these are a one two three and a 789 triple which must have the even digits in the middle that pair what is this digit 6 or eight that is got to be three then there we go now these must be 1 2 48 now um I don't know if that is worth pencil marking in detail but that's interesting because that is also either two or eight I don't know which way around they go that's annoying now how about here this doesn't have a three or a four in so it's one two that is powerful right eight there 79 there two here 1 three there so now the one two pair is up there this is the 48 pair and that is all flowing nicely very nicely lovely puzzle actually um this can't have a three in it so it's a 48 pair this now is a three 746 it really helps to keep in your mind a list an imaginary list of the potential black dot numbers um now I'm a bit stuck now this is not for see this is 10 or six by that list I was mentioning this can't be a 63 pair it doesn't have a four on it so it's got to be a 21 pair and that's sorts out the other one now eight is the even digit on that white dot don't know why I'm enunciating so clearly this has to be a 63 pair this one is obviously not a 63 pair I'm not going to try that yet oh this hasn't yielded as much as I was thinking right um now the even digit can't be two because one and three are used up so it has to be four there that is a naked nine weirdly helpful digit excellent one two that gives me another two and 2 4 three eight five s and six let's go across the middle row and stick in a two and an eight and a 47 pair that now must be 8 9 with a five there and a seven the other side 2 1 9 8 765 I don't think this puzzle is going to achieve Nemesis status happy to report 9376 there five there that must be attaching to a four eight and nine to go in the column oh I've got an iwing in column five six and seven still to play B 8632 41 five is there and that's a 79 pair what about this box two has to be there 863 up at the top we can do all of those there's a three in the corner again hurah 79 so 7 six oh those 79s are going to be resolved D from the verticals interesting 5 7 6 1 9 8 9 7 99 7 3 minutes 52 seconds the two hat time was 8.16 is that a multiple of 129 no I don't know why this time is 8816 oh yes I do it is a 2:1 ratio fair enough um but anyway well inside the two Hat Time absolutely cruising today really they are the opposite of last week's puzzles um and here we go on 10 to a dozen haven't really seen this rule set before so let's get cracking on this the pairs add up ah that can't be a three so it doesn't add up to 12 we can't multiply up so so that's a one always start in box one with a clover puzzle good tip generally now these they can't multiply to 10 they could multiply to 12 with a four four S or nine none of them can be a four so that's seven and nine gosh this is quite complicated I don't think we're going to get such a quick time here this can't multiply so it adds and that's a two now four can take a six a three or an eight that one must be a six and now this one must be an eight I mean this is a way of doing it three can take seven n or four so that one is a nine and that one is a seven now we just worked out what four could take 68 or three neither of those can be a three so that's eight that's six okay thank you corners for being slightly helpful now what can six take you can't add to 12 or multiply to 10 so there's only two possibilities and one of them is four so it's a two to multiply to 12 that places two in box one I want to reduce this as far as possible to sidoku because I'm better at that than all the little bits of maths and remembering which bits I have to consider um 9 3 2 4 8 7 1 9 6482 that is a 35 pair which makes that four in the corner 2 and eight there 93248 648 235 these are from 179 now one now 1 n could be I don't know I I I don't like the aspect of this where I'm having to work out the calculations all the time around the grid thank God there's no negative constraint that's a seven by sodoku now that must be five or three cuz seven has to add it can't multiply um 742 68 so I don't know bit stuck there 867 uh what okay what about this this is four or two it's got to be four we can't be multiplying there that's not allowed to be a nine so that's a nine which goes with three or one um when there's an option I don't like taking that around the corner because I just don't feel competent to decide quickly what is possible and what isn't this is a 64 pair ah in fact we know the order so that's the nine in the column this is one one or five can't be three okay let's have a look at this dot shall we I'm just trying to find something else to do right 3 * 4 3 + 9 both of those ruled out so that can't be a three oh no that's not true there are other Alternatives 37 is possible five can't multiply so it would have to add a seven that's always a seven that's weird right so this is now five or three again seven can't multiply so we've got a pair that has been a very weird situation um it hasn't actually resolved as much as I need 8267 three one of those is a nine I hope Clover is generous with the hat times here because I am struggling with this whole concept okay one would need to add so it would be a nine yeah that's the only possibility three could have a four which it can't have to multiply or otherwise it adds with a nine or a seven that has to be a nine look at that weird symmetry play that is one or three that pair is actually useful this time 741 396 we've got two five and 8 to place in the row I wish that was more helpful um now is the 35 any more help I don't see how yes six in the row I can place there 1 2 49 still to go so that's one or two I don't know I don't know what to do this can't be a nine because nine is in one of those cells yes because of that nine okay come on let's just think clearly 6439 still 5 and a half minutes in already wow I don't find this easy at all um two is in one of those cells and it can't be next to the seven that wouldn't make any sense 2 37 so this is8 um I don't want to think about that 1587 oh that is a nine by sodoku well that must go with a one so now I do want to think about it now there's a two in one of those there's a three in one of those there's a four in one of those and there's a six in one of those do I have to think about this black rectangle no I don't I can look up here and get a three there and a five here and a three there and a one there three in the corner losing its religion one there okay that was good now that has become a one as well that might tidy up box three no some of it only but finishes Row three this has to be a five now CU I can use Prime with more facility oh no no no no no I don't know where this has gone wrong oh Clover has destroyed me here I have no idea how far back I have to go to fix that and I didn't think I'd done anything wrong oh I think I have to go back a long way oh my goodness me so I started on row four and it all looked good to me see it might be all right up to this I know let's go back and think about that seven first of all now I said this three needed either four nine or seven there and it could only be seven and the five had to be a seven five is powerful yeah it has to be a seven I think that's still right so that's right then seven has to add to either three or five that has to be right now one or three one must go with a nine it can't multiply up three goes with four 7even or nine so that's a nine this is therefore one or three cuz nine has to add then I started doing this row didn't I no I discovered that two yeah two has to be in one of those cells and can't be there so it's there in fact this seven needs a five here that's very clear now I see it that's a 68 pair maybe that's what I needed to do I mean I'm still concerned that this is just going to explode again in a moment cuz I don't see I don't see what I did wrong last time is if I'm being honest that's a one that's a three that makes this a five now my problem came here I put five8 there nine by sodoku has to be here that can go with a one okay we're not dead yet that's now a seven let's do the column first if we can seven has to go there is nothing seven can go with there my goodness I'm going to have to start again I'm already 9 Minutes in it's going to be my first dinosaur in a while isn't it I don't know what I've done wrong I'm going to start again so um I'll do it oh there's an option isn't there keep time there we go right let's try this again I'm sorry what a mess wow right now come on just focus three goes with four 4 7 or 99 I mean I don't think I've completely misunderstood the rules four goes with three 6 or eight 3 6 or8 so that's my start nine goes with three or one seven goes with five or three six can't go with six so it's a four no it's got to multiply by two eight could add four that's no good so it's got to add two that's all the Givens on the black dots that's one or three by sedu 5937 628 this is a 14 pair that's 6 a two there now six on the black dot I said it goes with two there it can go with four oh does go with four here 174 628 so 359 remaining in the column um looking along the bottom row that is 10 or three and there's a 26 pair there now that's seven with a 59 pair in the Box seven must go with five or three I hope I've done something different from last time I honestly can't remember enough about it to know that that's a 4 five pair these are from 137 459 731 286 286 um come on oh the eight needs a two or a four it's got to be a four that fixes five and four there uh these are 1379 oh there's only one place nine can go that's a bit weird um 9324 I mean I'm doing this in a different order that bodess reasonably well 3 S that can't be six or five now this is a 28 pair um now three joining 09 joins to one or three on the dot and that's still got to be right three can join to four S or nine I mean I still believe that and that would have to be a seven five can only join to seven seven can only join to three or five this becomes a nine I don't remember that yes I do remember that from last time I mean if this still goes wrong again I don't know what to do really I think it means I don't understand the rules then I mean there's every chance that's possibly right but all I can then do is rededicate myself to rereading the rules over which could be painfully revealing now seven has to go with five there I reckon I literally can't see how it could be anything else the five forces are three there 5 95 1 29 that uses a one so one goes in the corner oh we didn't get three in the corner this time at least that's different two and six can't do the 28 pair now one has to go with nine you can't I mean I I had thoughts about that you can't multiply it up that must be a nine nine then adds to either three or one and it's just broken again this is so weird what I mean I must have just misunderstood the rules so I'm going to put this together ignoring these black rectangles Les just to see if we can finish the puzzle this way I mean I'm that would have to be a one I'm only going to ignore those two rectangles CU they're the only things that are killing me everything else Works 732 I've really got something badly wrong here haven't I 5 7 3 1 9 6 2 4 and 8 that has to be a four I mean I I'm really really confused here so I I sort of think I'm in this position but how can two of those give a 12 or a 10 82 but those can't be here with the one so I'm ignoring one single rectangle to sort of well I can't ignore it because that determines this 28 deadly pattern how does that pair multiply or add to 10 or 12 and what am I doing wrong let's read the rules again pairs of digits separated by a black rectangle either add to 10 add to 12 multiply to 10 or multiply to 12 that's what I've understood have I got some actual pair in the puzzle wrong yeah look 26 what is that nonsense oh that no that multiplies to 12 that's not nonsense that's all right 1 n I don't understand right let's restart keep the time do it again I I mean I just I'm in a loop now this is the most puzzling and weird situation I've ever found myself in during gats going to start again right threes need either 9 7 or four 9 7 or four fours need either 8 three or six nine goes with either three or 1 six goes with either four or six it can't or two eight goes with either two or four so there or oh there's a seven here which goes with five or three so I mean those are all fixed that becomes an eight by sodoku and goes with a four or a two six by sodoku going with two or four that has to be a four okay this is the sort of symmetry I had not ever seen before in this puzzle there's a seven there going with five or three and have I got another version yeah there's a nine there by sodoku going with either one or three now three or five let's do this all over again three or five oh no let's first of all Mark 59 as a pair there 13 as a pair there 71 as a pair there 35 can go in there in fact 31 could go in there there is symmetry isn't there about all of this hadn't seen it before so maybe this has been worth it for me just to appreciate the Symmetry although I crave the party hat times more than that 42826 I mean it's again it looks so right it feels so right there must be some calculation that I'm just doing [Music] wrong these are from one 37 um yeah that a 2 pair is done I don't think that 59 pair or that 17 pair are done so 526 39 Oh that's become a one now they're done 8 four here they can be filled in that's that's a 39 pair I I'm not seeing any digits being different yet now one can't multiply up to 10 or 12 so it's got to add can't add to 12 so that's a nine nine has got to add it's got to go with three or one so that's a three I'm going to be in exactly the same situation in a moment here I'm going to have to give up I mean this is painful if if I get to the same situation all over again and I will I'm just going to have to give up I don't see what else I can do I can't keep just trying it again and getting the same wrong result that obviously Einstein's definition of Madness comes into play now this might be where it's gone wrong where I always think this has to be a seven 3 * 4 not allowed 3 + 9 not allowed 3 + 7 is allowed 5 + 5 five isn't allowed oh five times two you monkey that's what it is I'd never thought of 5 * 2 oh it's so embarrassing that is a five anyway and it is five time well I know it's five * 2 but let's leave the seven as a possibility so that we're doing this logically I only know it because I keep failing um oh you Absolut criminal fool gosh one and six there and obviously seven doesn't work but six works with two 5 * 2 why did I not see that as a way to get to tell I've got no explanation actually no explanation that is a weird mental black spot wow I mean I really embarrassed myself here I think at least I've solved the puzzle this time but how could I keep making that mistake again and again and again I must have done it three times I mean it solves beautifully there we go 21 minutes you're not going to give me a hat for 21 minutes and 18 seconds Clover and you certainly shouldn't thir 13 minutes was the one Hat Time 7 minutes was the two Hat Time might not have even made seven minutes the way I was going the first time to be fair so I may have only wasted one hat but I have achieved a dinosaur for the first time in well Miko kissai will tell us how long it is since I achieved a dinosaur but I would suspect it's the bones of a year maybe more since a dinosaur but I've got one today dinosaur day right bill restore my faith in myself slightly please let's play the Giller sadoku okay so a one two pair and a three four pair and a five in the six cage gives a one we got two and three and that must be four and I'm doing this in rhyme no not rhyme in Rhythm um right 15 14 is 29 so that has to be a 59 pair like that 87 above um 9 875 that has to be a six this has to be 57 ooh there's a seven X-Wing putting a seven in one of those cells that can't have seven or six that's a 35 pair so there's a three in one of those cells this is seven or eight so that's got to be two excellent [Music] um that's a 2 three pair that is nine or eight and therefore has to be eight this can't be 85 but I don't know about the other possibilities that's a two three pair in fact I know the order so four there one there two there right let's do this column cuz symmetry is always our friend that's a naked eight nine there ah don't know how to do the other digits I do know how to type but barely um 2 three and four still to go in the row 9 3 2 4 1 um what about this pair I kept thinking this pair was going to be helpful not really I've got a 689 triple at the top that makes that a seven 4 6 8 9 7 I don't know 857 this isn't getting any easier as we go that's eight or nine 4 2 53 so that's a 97 pair then I can do eight and six now this has to be 34 3 47 that's a five that's two or three so that's eight then this is a 69 pair uh this is A6 triple ah why can't I do these cages yet still can't as far as I can see that's 124 triple 683 579 I really am looking forward to getting this video finished and getting out of this gas Loop we will not be long now um 85 6 7 785 69 that is a 13 pair that is a 42 pair right three in the corner no time to celebrate that and very little to celebrate today that's now a 67 pair this is nine with a 54 beneath it that's seven in that corner this one has become a nine that makes this an eight uh this is now 76 as I suspected the whole time I imagine this is definitely 35 although I can't see that yet 6 7 8 that's become a nine 1 2 3 4 5 still to place in the column I wish that was getting easier we're nearly done though come on nearly done um three xwing puts a three there gosh that was quite complicated seven and five there six and seven there 7 3 2 6 5 we've got 1 48 to place so that's the eight and that one is one or four this is two or four um we are we've got a six s pair there so eight gets done that does the six seven pair pairs and that's 615 up the side that's become a four there we go we're on the home straight now six four can't typ 412 53 that's a one if I could get there two and eight the two fixes rows five and six which are the last things we've got left to do and there we go 4 minutes 50 just back to normal eight and a half minutes for the two hats so eight hats and one big big old dinosaur what was the dinosaur in Clover's puzzle in fact that was nominated it was a disc calic disoosa surus how appropriate is that for me shockingly is the answer shockingly appropriate so the dinosaur roams the PLS of gas tonight and uh catches me wow that's beyond Nemesis into into saour pod territory thank you very much for watching and enjoying my discomfort with one of the puzzles tonight um but I still enjoyed them because it's still gas and it's still soku I can't help it I'm just an Enthusiast see you again on the channel tomorrow bye for now\""
